# Snake - MatrixProject

# Backstory

Snake is a very simple game, but it's also very popular. I used to play it on the Nokia 3310 when I was a kid, so I chose to make this game.

# Game Description

I suppose everyone knows how the Snake game Works. 
But if you don't, here's all you need to know to play it:
<li> You are a Snake who is HUNGRY, and you need to Eat so you will not die. </li>
<li> The food will blink on the matrix, so it will be easy to see. </li>
<li> After you Eat the food, the snake lenght and the score will increase </li>

  <summary> <h6> Bugs </h6> </summary>
  
  <li> Small lag when increasing the snake's length. It won't increase immediately. I see it as an Easter Egg, because you don't grow immediately after you eat, you always need to waitðŸ˜œ</li>
  <li> Sometimes the food changes is position when started the game. </li>
